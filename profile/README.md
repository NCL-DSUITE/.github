# D-Suite
## About
D-suite is exploring how power electronics devices can help monitor and manage low-voltage distribution networks, in the face of growing demand for renewable electricity.

D-Suite is a partially rated Low Voltage (LV) Power Electronic hardware demonstrator that will use a LV design tool, developed in Beta, to optimally place and size the partially rated Power Electronic Devices (PED) hardware. The hardware will be capable of
- Mitigating phase voltage and current imbalance.
- Managing feeder voltage profiles.
- Balancing feeder and transformer loading.

The 59-month Project aims to create a cost competitive solution to traditional reinforcement, that can be rolled out at scale after the Beta Phase trial. The Project will leverage £8.06m of SIF funding to release £795m of total benefit for customers GB-wide.
