# D-Suite: LV Design Tool
## About
D-Suite is exploring how power electronics devices can help manage low voltage (LV) distribution networks, in the face of growing low carbon technologies (LCTs) such as solar PV, heat pumps, and electric vehicles.

The Beta phase of the D-Suite project proposes to demonstrate a suite of partially rated Power Electronic Devices (PEDs) and an LV Design Tool. The LV Design Tool will undertake technology selection and choose the optimal siting and size of the PEDs. The PEDs will be capable of
- Mitigating phase voltage and current imbalance.
- Managing feeder voltage profiles.
- Balancing feeder and transformer loading.

Overall, the 59-month Project aims to create a cost competitive solution to traditional reinforcement, that can be rolled out at scale after the Beta Phase trial. The Project will leverage £8.06m of SIF funding to release £795m of total benefit for customers GB-wide.
